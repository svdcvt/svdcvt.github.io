Hi, salut, привет! I am a Ph.D. student at University Grenoble Alpes and INRIA, I work with [Bruno Raffin](https://datamove.imag.fr/bruno.raffin/) in [Datamove team](https://team.inria.fr/datamove/). 

My research is focused on improving the data-efficiency of a deep neural network training on a data which comes from physics simulators and PDEs. I am also a member of Melissa project which develops a framework for large scale deep surrogate training on HPC systems.
