Hi, salut, привет! I am a last-year Ph.D. student at University Grenoble Alpes and INRIA (France), I work with [Bruno Raffin](https://datamove.imag.fr/bruno.raffin/) in [Datamove team](https://team.inria.fr/datamove/). I am a member of [Melissa project](https://linktr.ee/melissa.inria) which develops a framework for efficient large-scale deep surrogate training on HPC systems.

My thesis research question is:
> "How to make training of data-driven surrogates more data-efficient, i.e., obtaining high-quality surrogate with fewer generated simulation data?"
The cost of generating training data from physical solvers is a major bottleneck in scientific deep learning, it especially limits the scaling of deep surrogate models application to complex real-world problems. Compared to classical deep learning, with solvers we have the power to create data, but with such power comes the question: "Which data to generate?". Currently, the data is created uniformly across input parameters of a solver. *Is it really the best way?* It was my thesis goal to close this gap. I developed an active learning method that reduces the number of training data simulations required by choosing more informative input parameters based on surrogate training loss. See publications below and my [presentation at SC 2024](https://youtu.be/WUfa6SunwGc?si=zjwIf1VKYd00T9lH) for more details. 

After defending my thesis (February-March 2026), I plan to continue working in the field of AI for Science. I want (1) to work back-to-back in a team of passionate researchers and engineers, (2) to apply my skills and knowledge to solving real-world scientific cases, (3) to stay connected to the scientific community by publishing open-source and attending conferences, and (4) to keep learning and developing myself in this fast-evolving field.
